This way, the need for large measuring tapes is eliminated and one needs to carry only a small object of known size, and an Android smartphone.\r\n\r\nConversions between length units is supported, and area measurement will be implemented in a later version.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n*TL,DR:*\r\n\r\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
