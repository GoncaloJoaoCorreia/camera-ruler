# Camera Ruler
Android app used to measure objects using a smartphone camera.
[Project Page](https://goncalojoaocorreia.github.io/camera-ruler/)

## The goal, and how to use it
This app was made as an alternative to time-consuming measurements by hand needed by professionals of various fields. 
It is not meant for exact measurements where you need millimetric precision, but instead used for plausible estimates and quick prototyping.

It works using a reference size on the same plane as the object the user wants to measure. This way, the need for large measuring tapes is eliminated and one needs to carry only a small object of known size, and an Android smartphone.

Conversions between length units is supported, and area measurement will be implemented in a later version.
